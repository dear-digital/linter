# Linter: AI-Driven Code Optimization Tool

## Project Description:

This project aims to develop a code optimization tool utilizing artificial intelligence. The tool will be designed to identify potential areas for code optimization, detect bugs, and suggest improvements. It will be designed to function as a standalone application, a VS Code extension, or a GitHub Action, contributing towards enhancing the developer experience. In addition to AI-driven functionalities, the tool will also have a suite of features that can be used independently, such as linting instructions.

## 🚀 Internship Overview: (Updated!)

This internship offers an opportunity for aspiring developers to contribute to an open-source project and gain real-world development experience. Interns will have the opportunity to work on various aspects of the project, with a focus on their areas of interest. Evaluation will be based on the quantity and quality of their contributions, quantified through a point-based system.

### Updated Project Workflow (New!)

Starting from now, the project will operate under a milestone-based approach. Each week will have specific milestones set by the project lead, and issues will be focused on accomplishing those milestones. Interns with more than 100 points on the leaderboard will be assigned tasks by the project lead, which they are expected to complete within the week.

#### Weekly Commitments and Stipends (New!)

- Interns are expected to accumulate at least 375 points each week.
- A week in which an intern fails to accumulate 375 points will not be considered part of the internship and will be treated as a break. A new week will begin only after they successfully complete their previous tasks.
- Interns achieving 375 points per week for 4 consecutive weeks will receive a stipend of 120EUR.
- After accumulating points for 8 consecutive weeks, interns will have the opportunity to take on 500-point tasks for a month, success in which may lead to a permanent position.

## 🎯 Points System: (Updated!)

Each contribution you make towards the project earns you points. This includes, but is not limited to:

1. **No More Self-Created Issues:** From now on, issues will be created only by the project lead.
2. **Issue Assignment:** Issues are assigned to interns who have more than 100 points on the leaderboard.
3. **Open Issues:** Some issues may be left unassigned. If you propose a correct solution/intent in the comments, the issue will be assigned to you. This way you can reach 100 points if you are a beginner, **Lookout for issues with label "Open Task"**
4. **Weekly Milestones:** Focus on the week's milestones when working on assigned issues.

The point values for each task will be determined based on its complexity and significance to the project. The points leaderboard will be updated daily and can be viewed in the Points.md file.

## 🎓 Mentorship and Feedback Sessions: (Updated!)

There will be no more live feedback sessions, Any discussion can be carried out in the discussions channel.

## 💡 Community Discussions

GitHub Discussions is our chosen platform for building a community around our project. Here, you'll not only find vibrant conversations around the project's development but also get to observe first-hand how the project evolves and progresses.

### How are Discussions different from Issues?

While Issues are meant to be more formal and are usually tied to specific tasks or problems, Discussions serve as a less structured platform for questions, ideas, and collaborative problem-solving. They offer a more communal approach to contributing to the project, allowing for brainstorming sessions, polls, Q&As, and even casual conversations around the project's domain.

### The Importance of Participating in Discussions

Active participation in discussions is crucial to maintaining a clear understanding of the project's trajectory. The conversations, especially the polls, could influence major decisions regarding the project's direction. Hence, contributing to discussions is compulsory for all project members. 

To recognize the importance of active discussion participation, we are planning to implement a points system for discussions. Details on the criteria and allocation will be released soon, so stay tuned!

### Keeping Yourself Updated

Reviewing discussions regularly ensures you are kept abreast of the latest updates, decisions, and the overall direction of the project. It's not just about contributing to the conversations; it's about understanding the evolving context of the project.

### Current Project Phase

Refactoring and adding coding style rules.

## Stay Updated:

This project is in a state of active development and is constantly evolving. Rules and guidelines can change from time to time. To ensure you're always up to speed, we strongly recommend regularly reviewing the README and its change history. Checking the commit history of the README file can give you an idea of when the last changes were made. Staying updated will ensure you're always following the latest guidelines and requirements of the project. Remember, knowledge is power!
